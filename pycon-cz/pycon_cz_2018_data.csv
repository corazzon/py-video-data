While we can not improve the radiologist’s ability to detect and classify cancer nodules directly, we can leverage the power of machine learning algorithms we have today together with the data from the past and build a medical support decision system to advise the doctors and warn them, if there is a potentially dangerous nodule detected.

We decided to get our hands dirty and build such a system. After extensive research and understanding of the problem domain we obtained a labeled dataset which would later be used for the training of our models. The next step was to understand the data we have, uncover hidden biases and handling the data from different sources and formats.

Changing application logic to handle streams rather than loading the whole dataset into memory.
Actually scaling up – locally by buying more memory and/or faster disk drives, or by deploying servers in the cloud and SSH tunneling to remote Jupyter instances.
Scaling your data source and utilizing pandas' SQL connector. This will help in other areas as well (e.g. direct connections in BI).
Using a distributed DataFrame engine – Dask or PySpark. These scale from laptops to large clusters, using the very same API the whole way through.
I will cover the various differences between these approaches and will outline their set of upsides (e.g. scaling and performance) and downsides (DevOps difficulties, cost).",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJsdeIcU9HE/hqdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJsdeIcU9HE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJsdeIcU9HE

Proč bychom měli děti učit programovat i přesto, že ze všech nechceme mít programátory? Proč a jak se dnes učí programovat děti v jiných zemích Evropy a světa? Jak je na tom ČR a co se chystá.

Jak začít. Jak rozjet svůj vlastní kroužek, i když třeba škola nemá počítačovou učebnu. Jak uspořádat jednorázovou programovací akci pro děti a rodiče. Jak rozvíjet informatické myšlení už u předškolních dětí, v čem, co a jak mohou programovat děti ze základní školy.

It allows developers to create websites without using Django, Flask or other synchronous web frameworks.

Let's talk about why asyncio stack became popular for web development among Pythonistas, especially in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Russia, etc). I will tell you about projects that are using it and how they compare to more traditional ones.

I will also talk about lessons learned from developing, testing and deploying application used to sign legal documents online in Ukraine: aiohttp.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FkoQJrGOUZg/hqdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkoQJrGOUZg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkoQJrGOUZg

After many years of very light almost non-maintenance only by the brave RHEL maintainer, I have taken over M2Crypto to port it to Py3k and hoped to be done in a month the most. Now, two years later, the merge finally happened and M2Crypto has another chance to survive in the world where Py3k compatibility is a necessity.

This presentation is about the experience of porting large project combining Python and C from 2.5 to Py3k compliance. I would like to describe the biggest problems and tools which helped me. The formers were (aside from plenty of lingering bugs) complete mess of using 'bytes' and 'str' in Py2k code. What helped a lot were PEP-484 annotations (working in Py2k in the comment form), compatibility macros which are actually present in Python since 2.6.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/znF2wVjdb0k/hqdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znF2wVjdb0k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znF2wVjdb0k

It solves it completely, it's so fast, it's old, rock solid and well tested – and difficult to use, because it has that real-world, well aged C-API. Maybe even C++. So, you want to use it from Python, but there's no wrapper yet? Or worse, the existing wrapper is auto-generated and feels clumsy, slow and just as ugly to work with as C?

Give Cython a try! It's the fastest way to make Python talk (to) native code, and a pleasure to work with as a general programming language.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dv_ScYgh8os/hqdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv_ScYgh8os,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv_ScYgh8os

With this task is possible to control the progression of brood, bees, and food reserves. Since each frame can have thousands of cells, in most cases this task is done by a human in an approximate way, making it error-prone. The automation of this process, using image analysis represents an evolution in this field.

The honey bee is the world’s most important pollinator of food crops. Almost one-third of the food that we consume each day relies on pollination done mainly by bees. So the creation of software that helps the preservation of this species has a direct impact on our lives.

I am going to show you a few challenges we have faced, from creating comb cell detectors using OpenCV and Shapely, to developing models based on Deep Learning to classify the cell's content using the Caffe framework. With these models, we have obtained accuracy above 98% within eight different classes and solved the proposed problem.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zunVyo2-eJs/hqdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zunVyo2-eJs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zunVyo2-eJs
