Accompanying the diversity and growing volume of the complex biological datasets, called “–omics” data (e.g., genomics and proteomics), revolutionized our understanding and our way of interpreting disease and health states, although they generate new challenges.

To reveal the complex and hidden patterns in omics data, machine learning (ML) showed promising results and brought new opportunities for transforming scientific discovery today. Popular packages such as scikit-learn or XGBoost enable predictive data analysis. However, the researchers still require programming skills to write their own ML pipelines which are not always easy to follow by non-specialists due to lacking domain knowledge and a graphical interface.

Furthermore, several parameters can be changed to tune the algorithms, which might show differences from version to version, resulting in reproducibility issues. To reproduce published results, the same software environment needs to be set up and configured with the matching package versions and algorithm parameters.

Additionally, omics sciences and ML require special domain knowledge since metrics can be deceiving and algorithms might need extra preselection or preprocessing steps.

Thus, transparent and open-source software is highly valuable for open and reproducible science. To address all the issues and to enable researchers to access state-of-the-art ML algorithms without requiring any prior bioinformatics and programming knowledge, we introduce OmicLearn (OmicLearn.org), a ready-to-use, open-source, web-based, ML platform specifically developed for omics datasets.

Like most other businesses, it is primarily interested in maximising the number of orders fulfilled, and that’s why they use asynchronous processing: when you ask for your coffee, the cashier marks a cup with your order and places it into a queue. Queuing orders decouples cashiers and baristas, allowing the cashier to keep taking orders and the deployment of many baristas at peak times. At scale, it would be absurd to see a cashier taking an order and fulfilling it before moving on with the next customer. Yet, we often rely on very similar strategies when we code.

Asynchronous programming has become a huge hit, and there are two main reasons for it. First, it mitigates the problems of systems that make multiple external requests to serve one incoming request (fan-out), making them way faster. And second, it helps save money on infrastructure by using resources better.

However, many Python developers, while intrigued, are intimidated by this programming paradigm, and so the goal of this talk is to help figure out how the heck all of this works. In order to do so, what I’m going to do is to review how async was incorporated into Python using the building blocks that all Python developers are already familiar with, such as iterators and generator expressions.

We will use that foundation to dive into coroutines, the yield from syntax, and finally, async/await. At the end of the talk, we may build a simple web-crawler using what we’ve learnt, and understand the internals of async web services such as Starlette or aiohttp.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/x_R_uxrLRR8/maxresdefault.jpg,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_R_uxrLRR8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_R_uxrLRR8
