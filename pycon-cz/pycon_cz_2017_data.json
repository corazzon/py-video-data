Another died because of a camera’s inability to distinguish colours from one another, and yet another died because of bad GPS data. Many thousands more deaths could have been prevented by a single variable, if the developers had thought to include it.\n\nAs software developers, our skills and ideas are increasingly crucial for keeping the world running. We don’t have time to test for, find, and fix all of the bugs. Most bugs are annoying, some bugs allow for sneaky behaviour, but the most innocuous of edge cases can sometimes lead to an actual loss of life.\n\nNo software ever holds up to contact with reality, but in this talk, Lilly Ryan shows you some of the more extreme consequences of tech debt, and offers guidelines on how your team can more easily identify assumptions and eliminate edge case behaviour when developing software. That boring task hiding in your backlog might just save a life.",

        "description": "'MicroPython on the water' has been created from pure interest and passion for MicroPython – a Python 3.5 implementation for embedded/bare metal systems. MicroPython is a wonderful project, however, it deserves some love to isolate its core and use it within a realtime environment. The talk shows a potential approach how to run MicroPython as a task within FreeRTOS. The actual use case is a 2-cycle combustion engine management software for an RC model boat. The system takes care of sampling exhaust gas temperature, engine rpm and other useful telemetry data. MicroPython provides a very comfortable environment for implementing the inconvenient-to-write-in-C-business logic like storing telemetry data on an SD card, processing remote commands from the pilot and changing parameters of the engine management system accordingly.\n\nThe talk also shows how MicroPython can be plugged into a Kconfig based configuration management tool that is known from Linux kernel. The software ecosystem builds micropython as one of its components among HAL drivers, sensor software libraries, and last but not least the RTOS",

Marconi’s tale is a master class in the necessity of open source technology, as well as being a delightful introduction to the art of vulnerability reporting.",

In essence, this says that a python program cannot do more than one thing at once via threading. There is a lot of misconception in a lot of Python Programmers regarding Global Interpreter Lock. Most of them think its the worst part of Python.\n\nI will try to demonstrate how it actually works and how we can leverage multiple CPU cores for multithreading for I/O and CPU Bound task using C-Extensions. I will also show some comparisons with different implementations of Python and the presence or absence of GIL in those, to answer questions like, why we can't just remove it from CPython and solve all our problems or why Jython performs better in Multithreading for CPU Bound task.",

        "description": "Data, data, data and even more data. How can we handle all this data, of course by analysing them with Python :) But neither Python nor any other program, software etc. can tell us the story, which is hidden in the data. The story is created by a human interaction with the data. In this process data visualisation is our friend as it helps us to discover patterns, outliers and everything we need to create the data story. At the same time data visualisation is a language we all understand and enjoy using, therefore it is the logical bridge between the data and the story. In this talk I want to show you why we love visual storytelling and inspire your own imagination by explaining to you how one of the best visual data stories have been created\n-----\nSandra’s biggest passion is and always was analysing and visualising data in order to discover the world.\n\nWithin the last 10 years she had the pleasure to design statistical models and create analytical solutions in various interesting projects while working in market research institutes, brand, media and advertisement agencies in Germany, UK and Spain.\n\nSara is German but she would consider heself already as half Spanish as she've been living in her favourite city of Madrid for nearly three years now. In her last position she'd led the data visualisation training program for Telefonica Spain and LATAM by helping them to understand, use and communicate their data in an efficient, attractive and dynamic way.\n\nNow as a profesor and teacher for data visualisation she has the possibility to focus on new ways to explore and represent data, especially using open source software like D3.js, R shiny & ggplot2, Python and CARTO and with a passion for the visual storytelling. Her final objective is to transmit high quality knowledge combined with enjoyment.",

        "description": "You may have heard the quote “Software is eating the world” to describe how services like Airbnb, Uber, Slack and Skype are replacing the likes of hotels, taxis and the office commute. As software engineers, part of our job is accelerating this shift. And it’s easy to think that a shift from moving atoms, to moving bits, is a net win for the planet.\n\nHowever, moving all those bits for our sites around takes servers. And these servers run on electricity. And most of this electricity powering our servers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning these is a key driver of climate change – the kind of disruption we don’t want.\n\nSo, what can we do? We’re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime soon, but we can change how we build online services to make them greener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing existing techniques from web performance optimisation, containerisation, and serverless, as well as good old common sense.\n\nThis talk will show how we can use the tools in the python developer's toolbox today for more planet-friendly, sustainable web development, and how this is also good engineering practice.\n------\nChris Adams started using Django in 2008. Over the past ten years he's worked in startups and agencies, as a sysadmin, product manager, developer, and user researcher, and UX consultant, but keeps coming back to Python and Django.",

        "description": "With the advent of new amazing front-end frameworks and the ever-increasing power of browsers and mobile processors, webapp users expect a dynamic, seamless user experience where page refresh is out of the question. We Pythonistas love Django for web development, but server-side template rendering is not cool anymore. What do? Use Django as a pure back-end.\n\nIn this talk, technologies, strategies and third-party packages will be discussed, which will enable you to hit the ground running when tackling your first decoupled project or using Django in the context of a hybrid architecture. Furthermore, we will discuss how web development has changed through the years, aiming to find the mindset that will keep Django (and by extension Python as a web development language) relevant in the future.\n------\nCarlos is a Pythonista and Django developer from Madrid, Spain. Though he wouldn't consider programming his vocational calling (probably music is), he loves open source and free software ever ince he has discovered it. That led him to be an occasional teacher and mentor, introducing rogramming and the hacker mindset to young people.\n\nHe believes, that real technological literacy, as opposed to technological consumerism, is integral to building a better society: developers are in a privileged position and openness, transparency and ease of access are fundamental. Communities play a vital role here: programming can be a cold, lonely and dehumanized enterprise, but in communities we can find warmth and meaning.\n\nThis year he spoke at DjangoCon Europe, where he delivered a speech in the hope of being useful and giving a glimpse of his own experiences with Django. Currently he works for a small data analysis and intelligence start-up as the lead developer, which is quite a challenge, but a learning experience with every step.",

And we see how to go for your first fish today.\n\nOpen source projects are great opportunity for getting a lot of experience from community and also how to give something back. But if you are a new to all of this, you might find it overwhelming. We will get through some main tips for contributing in beginners-friendly projects and also starting one of your own.

        "description": "For the past three years, my colleagues and I have been developing and operating a Python system that trades in the stock market.\n\nI am going to tell you a story of how we developed and scaled this platform. We made some rather good decisions, as well as many mistakes that everyone can learn from. Some of our code is open source and you can use it in your own projects.\n\nWe started with a small event-driven application built with asyncio. As our trading expanded, our application has grown into a multi-agent monolith: hundreds of modules operating in a single asyncio-managed process. Today, we are moving to a more distributed approach. Some parts of the platform run in isolated processes and communicate asynchronously.\n\nI am going to show you a few challenges we have faced on this journey, and what they taught us about Python, asyncio, distributed systems, debugging, and making painful compromises. You don't need to know anything about trading. In fact, it turns out that these are mostly quite fundamental computer science problems that pop up over and over again, regardless of what you're building…\n------\nVíťa travels the world, writes software and ponders on philosophy.\n\nHe likes to solve hard problems, preferably involving mathematics, finance and lots of data. Python has been his language of choice for many years and lately he's very much into latest developments like asyncio and type hints.",
