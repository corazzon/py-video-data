        "description": "Mnoho, zejména mladých lidí, přivádí k programování touha vytvořit hru. Tato touha může být zmařena při nahlédnutí do učebnic programování, které poznatky budují systematicky a pro začátečníka mnohdy nepochopitelně.\nPřednáška ukazuje, jak lze začít tvořit a hrát si s jednoduchými grafickými objekty bez znalostí programování. Společně definujeme několik grafických objektů, které rozpohybujeme po grafickém plátně a jednoduchým zachycením událostí z klávesnice zabezpečíme možnost interaktivního ovládání hry.",

We’ll introduce some basic libraries to help with statistics and analysis and then cover how to document and explore your findings.\n\nIt’s assumed you have a working understanding of Python and its data types and structures, and that you’ve used and understand Python for basic scripting. It’s also assumed you haven’t done much in terms of data analysis, and you’d like to learn more. If this is you, welcome!",

By providing comprehensive guide to today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop Python entirely.\n\nThere have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of which is Larry Hasting's project called GILectomy, which I hope to shed some light on.",

        "description": "Web APIs are often called REST APIs, which recently became a part of the everyday life of many Python developers. Sure, it can be a blast to build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code, set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill. Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has baked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting and boring stuff\nfor you while allowing you to alter the test cases with arbitrary Python code.\n\nLet Judge Dredd do your API justice.",

        "description": "Open-sourced and inner-sourced projects often struggle to get engagement. Communities, such as Github and PyPi, are host to redundant projects and libraries. In the development space, how do you distinguish your project from others, get people excited to contribute to it, and ultimately create a successful open source project? The answer is to apply user-centered design techniques to the development of your project. User-centered design is usually applied to web applications and products on the front-end of a website, but these techniques can be applied to open source libraries. In user-centered open source projects, your users are those who type `pip install $your_library`. In this talk, Jackie will illustrate some user-centered techniques that have been used on her own project - Mesa (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), along with other successful open source projects.",

During our talk we will share the story of how we, a small but dedicated group of people, jump started the community in a small country like Albania and what other small cities and countries should avoid during their first steps in developing a Python community in similar conditions.\nMost important we will share tips and tricks on how to keep the Python spirit alive for a long time after the first enthusiastic steps, with the goal that our shared experience will help other communities to make the first steps or grow even further. Also nowadays we are witnessing that the number of girls involved in technical fields, especially development, is really low and we are going to present what as the influence on low participation of girls and the steps we should take to fix it.",

Amongst other things we at CommOps are trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and the insights we have generated from them.",

TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem. This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.\n\nI will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:\n- What makes a problem seemingly impossible\n- How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard\n- How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity\n- Why Python might be a good hammer for that\n\nFollow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the final design (puzzle #4 \"the Dice\", TMOU 17 http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?",

Anyone who tried implementing it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to remember and which tools are worth to check.\n\nThe talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable. \nI will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover technical problems we encountered:\n* how to test that a service implements an API;\n* how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;\n* how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.\n\nAs theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help, describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to implement microservices integration tests @Growbots.",
