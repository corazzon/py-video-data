* the API is secured by a secret token/password/cookie...

Amongst other things we at CommOps are trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and the insights we have generated from them.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/tY05tRpJhgw/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY05tRpJhgw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY05tRpJhgw

Some people have turned cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem. This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for others to solve.

I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:
- What makes a problem seemingly impossible
- How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard
- How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity
- Why Python might be a good hammer for that

Follow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the final design (puzzle #4 ""the Dice"", TMOU 17 http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka).

Anyone who tried implementing it realizes that often the problem is not to design or formally specify the API (with Swagger or other tool). The problem is to keep the specification, servers and clients consistent and easy to maintain for longer. I will talk about what practices you need to remember and which tools are worth to check.

The talk will start with the basics of microservices architecture. I will describe some mistakes we have made that turned our microservices architecture fragile and unmanageable. 
I will show how we redesigned our API using Swagger and what principles you should have in mind when doing so. I will also cover technical problems we encountered:
* how to test that a service implements an API;
* how to avoid writing validation that is already specified in the swagger file;
* how to create clients and stub and who should maintain them.

As theory is not enough here, I will also show some tools that help, describe in detail connexion library and show how we used it to implement microservices integration tests @Growbots.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xVF7eJ2limg/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVF7eJ2limg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVF7eJ2limg
