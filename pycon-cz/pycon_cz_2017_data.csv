As software engineers, part of our job is accelerating this shift. And it’s easy to think that a shift from moving atoms, to moving bits, is a net win for the planet.

However, moving all those bits for our sites around takes servers. And these servers run on electricity. And most of this electricity powering our servers comes from burning fossil fuels. And burning these is a key driver of climate change – the kind of disruption we don’t want.

So, what can we do? We’re not going to stop sharing cat pics anytime soon, but we can change how we build online services to make them greener, load faster, and convert better, by borrowing existing techniques from web performance optimisation, containerisation, and serverless, as well as good old common sense.

This talk will show how we can use the tools in the python developer's toolbox today for more planet-friendly, sustainable web development, and how this is also good engineering practice.

We Pythonistas love Django for web development, but server-side template rendering is not cool anymore. What do? Use Django as a pure back-end.

In this talk, technologies, strategies and third-party packages will be discussed, which will enable you to hit the ground running when tackling your first decoupled project or using Django in the context of a hybrid architecture. Furthermore, we will discuss how web development has changed through the years, aiming to find the mindset that will keep Django (and by extension Python as a web development language) relevant in the future.

Carlos is a Pythonista and Django developer from Madrid, Spain. Though he wouldn't consider programming his vocational calling (probably music is), he loves open source and free software ever ince he has discovered it. That led him to be an occasional teacher and mentor, introducing rogramming and the hacker mindset to young people.

He believes, that real technological literacy, as opposed to technological consumerism, is integral to building a better society: developers are in a privileged position and openness, transparency and ease of access are fundamental. Communities play a vital role here: programming can be a cold, lonely and dehumanized enterprise, but in communities we can find warmth and meaning.

This year he spoke at DjangoCon Europe, where he delivered a speech in the hope of being useful and giving a glimpse of his own experiences with Django. Currently he works for a small data analysis and intelligence start-up as the lead developer, which is quite a challenge, but a learning experience with every step.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NptFO5S6tLo/maxresdefault.webp,0,False,False,public,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NptFO5S6tLo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NptFO5S6tLo

It's full of small and nice projects, bigger and nicer ones and it's also full of uncontrolled collaboration in big repositories. If you go fishing for the first time, you don't try to catch a shark, but try to have some luck with trouts in the neighbourhood lake. And we see how to go for your first fish today.

Open source projects are great opportunity for getting a lot of experience from community and also how to give something back. But if you are a new to all of this, you might find it overwhelming. We will get through some main tips for contributing in beginners-friendly projects and also starting one of your own. Public contribution will never feel like a walk of shame!

I am going to tell you a story of how we developed and scaled this platform. We made some rather good decisions, as well as many mistakes that everyone can learn from. Some of our code is open source and you can use it in your own projects.

We started with a small event-driven application built with asyncio. As our trading expanded, our application has grown into a multi-agent monolith: hundreds of modules operating in a single asyncio-managed process. Today, we are moving to a more distributed approach. Some parts of the platform run in isolated processes and communicate asynchronously.

I am going to show you a few challenges we have faced on this journey, and what they taught us about Python, asyncio, distributed systems, debugging, and making painful compromises. You don't need to know anything about trading. In fact, it turns out that these are mostly quite fundamental computer science problems that pop up over and over again, regardless of what you're building…
