Your editor probably magically adds it there. Do you need it? How do you use it? What is it for? How does it work? This will be an introductory level talk. I’ll talk about the history of shebangs, about problems shebangs are trying to solve, new challenges they bring and why you should not use them directly. I'll talk about execution, permissions, PATH, Linux distro packaging, entrypoints, emojis, crazy autotools templates, cool shebangs and the shortest script that deletes itself.

Hence why big companies such as Google and Microsoft have created their own ports of the notebooks: Google Colab and Azure Notebooks. But how well do notebooks perform in different contexts and standards? Are these suitable for all audiences and applications? This talk will dive into some of the best and lesser known features of the Jupyter notebooks and tools within the Jupyter ecosystem.

Thanks to genetically manipulated mice, we can study mechanisms of diseases and design effective treatments. After the genetically manipulated mice have been created, researches must examine all measurable traits, including metabolism, bone development, and behaviour. The measurements then have to be compared with the characteristics of the wild-type mice (mice that have not been genetically altered). This means a lot of data are generated every day.
